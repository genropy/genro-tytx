# TYTX 0.5.0 — First Public Release

TYTX is a typed-over-the-wire protocol for teams that need **type safety across Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript**, without locking into a specific framework.

## What’s inside
- **Cross-language HTTP helpers**: Same API in Python/JS/TS to send typed JSON, text, MessagePack, or XTYTX envelopes and auto-hydrate responses.
- **Async + server-side**: Python async wrappers; ASGI/WSGI middleware to hydrate incoming TYTX/XTYTX/JSON/text/msgpack. Node/TS ships `hydrateTypedBody` for Express/Koa/Fastify.
- **Schema-aware envelopes (XTYTX)**: Auto-attach local/global structs and JSON Schemas so consumers get **shape + data** in one round trip.
- **Structured types everywhere**: Built-in codes for Decimal, date/time, and custom structs; MessagePack, JSON, XML support; registry utilities to map to Pydantic/JSON Schema; helpers to import/export XSD/OpenAPI.
- **Interop-first**: Same typed markers across languages; optional msgpack; works with your existing HTTP stack (no Genropy dependency).

## Who should try it
- API teams tired of “stringly-typed” JSON and losing money/time on float/date bugs.
- Backends that want typed requests/responses without rewriting frameworks.
- Frontends/SDKs that need predictable shapes (schemas included) for docs, validation, or codegen.

## Why it matters
- **Less ambiguity**: Dates, decimals, times, and structs arrive already typed.
- **Lower integration cost**: Helpers set headers/content-types for you; middleware hydrates requests automatically.
- **Faster onboarding**: Drop-in helpers instead of bespoke serializers/deserializers.

Grab the HTTP helpers guide and try a round-trip: typed payloads in, typed objects out—end to end.***
